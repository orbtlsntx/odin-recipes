Odin recipes exercise..take 3. learning more about git and github than coding. more specifically what not to do, and how NOT to fix it. at a point in project where it's easier to start over than fiddle with commands. Hoping some more familiarity with proper commands will shed light on process for future trouble shooting endeavours, of which I am certain to encounter. If you are reading this I was successful.# odin-recipes
