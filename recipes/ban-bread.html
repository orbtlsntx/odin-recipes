<h4>Dad's Brilliant Banana Bread</h4>
<p>Bananas, the fruit of all fruits. a healthy 
    pre or post workout
    snack on it's own these golden phalic 
    wonders
    are a healthy choice in any diet. 
    That is, until dad gets hold of them.
    with a few ingredients (and puns thrown 
    in for good measure)
    he turns these
    golden potassium laden wonder fruits 
    from a 
    preworkout snack, to a 
    'reason why you have to 
    workout' snack. I always think to myself;
     "If 
    there's banana in the title can it really
     be that bad?" 
    (banana hammock not withstanding) May 
    the trickery begin.
